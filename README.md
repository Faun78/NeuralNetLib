# Neural Network

This code creates the neural network with multiple layers in main.cpp is an example of simple XOR function. To create a neural network use constructor of Neural_Network class. Provide the number of input parameters number of hidden nodes in hidden layers, number of outputs and number of hidden layers. There is also an optional parameter for turning off random generation of values.

To ask for answer simply use function feedforward with input values.
To train network simply use function train with input values and expected outputs.

This neural network was created with help of book "Make Your Own Neural Network by Tariq Rashid".
